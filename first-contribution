# Contributions

Using [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) on following the GitHub flow (Thank you [Guide to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#orienting-yourself-to-a-new-project)!), I am learning about creating branches and adding modifications to a branch before pushing it to the main. That's my first step in becoming a contributor on GitHub repos.
